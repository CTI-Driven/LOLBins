These parameters contain key information about the DLL payload, including the name, entry point, and optional arguments.\n        - The Detection Pseudocode looks for any instances of rundll32.exe but does no other filtering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the user that created the process) that helps reduce false positives.\"",
