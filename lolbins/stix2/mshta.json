According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”), the following major LockBit variants have been observed (first-observed dates in parentheses): ABCD (LockBit malware’s predecessor; September 2019), LockBit (January 2020), LockBit 2.0 (June 2021), LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker (October 2021), LockBit 3.0 (September 2022), LockBit Green (a variant that incorporates source code from Conti ransomware; January 2023), and variants capable of targeting macOS environments (April 2023). As of June 2023, CISA reported that the web panel that offers affiliates access to LockBit malware explicitly listed the LockBit 2.0, LockBit 3.0, LockBit Green, and LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker variants.[U.S. CISA Understanding LockBit June 2023] According to CISA, LockBit 3.0 (also known as “LockBit Black”) shares code similarities with Blackmatter and BlackCat ransomware and is “more modular and evasive\" than previous LockBit strains.[U.S. CISA LockBit 3.0 March 2023]",
